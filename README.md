# Construction-Project-Data-Generator
This repository contains a Python script that generates a large dataset for construction projects, customers, and materials. It creates a CSV file with randomly generated data, including project details, property information, builder ratings, and material usage. This dataset can be used for testing, simulation, or analysis in construction-related projects.

Synthetic Data Generation: Generates 100,000 records of data, including details for projects, builders, customers, materials, and properties.
Customizable Data: Uses pre-defined lists of builders and projects, with random values for fields like price, area, and customer information.
Detailed Project and Property Info: Includes fields such as projectCode, propertyCode, rateSqMeter, builderRating, and more.
